<p>Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contributing process easy and effective for everyone
involved.</p>
<p>Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you resepct the time of the developers managing and developing
this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing
patches and features.</p>
<p><a name="using-issue-tracker"></a></p>
<h3>Using the issue tracker</h3>
<p>This issue tracker is the preferred channel for <a href="#">bug reports</a>, <a href="#">feature requests</a> and <a href="#">submitting pull requests</a>,
but please respect the following restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please <strong>do not</strong> use the issue tracker for personal support requests (use <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>)</li>
<li>Please <strong>do not</strong> derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="bug-reports"></a></p>
<h3>Bug reports</h3>
<p>A bug is a <em>demonstrable problem</em> that is caused by the code in your repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!</p>
<p>Guidelines for bug reports:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use the GitHub issue search</strong><br />Check if the issue has already been reported</li>
<li><strong>Check if the issue has been fixed</strong><br />Try to reproduce it using the latest <code>master</code> or development branch in the repository.</li>
<li><strong>Isolate the problem</strong><br />Create a <a href="http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/">reduced test</a> case and a live example.</li>
</ul>
<p>A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as
possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS experience
the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Short and descriptive example bug report title</p>
<p>A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.</p>
<ol>
<li>This is the first step</li>
<li>This is the second step</li>
<li>Further steps, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>&lt;url&gt;</code> - a link to the reduced test case</p>
<p>Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
merits).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="feature-requests"></a></p>
<h3>Feature requests</h3>
<p>Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project.
It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide
as much detail and context as possible.</p>
<p><a name="pull-requests"></a></p>
<h3>Pull requests</h3>
<p>Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and
avoid containing unrelated commits.</p>
<p><strong>Please ask first</strong> before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code,
porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's
developers might not want to merge into the project.</p>
<p>Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other
requirements (such as test coverage).</p>
<p>Follow this process if you'd like your work considered for inclusion in the project:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/">Fork</a> the project, clone your fork,
and configure the remotes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
git clone https://github.com/centagon/build-core

# Navigate to the newly cloned directory
cd &lt;repo-name&gt;

# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
git remote add upstream https://github.com/&lt;upstream-owner&gt;/&lt;repo-name&gt;</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git checkout &lt;dev-branch&gt;
git pull upstream &lt;dev-branch&gt;</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to
contain your feature, change, or fix:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git checkout -b &lt;topic-branch-name&gt;</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these <a href="http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html">git commit
message guidelines</a>
or your code is unlikely be merged into the main project. Use Git's
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase">interactive rebase</a>
feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git pull [--rebase] upstream &lt;dev-branch&gt;</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Push your topic branch up to your fork:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git push origin &lt;topic-branch-name&gt;</code></pre>
</li>
<li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">Open a Pull Request</a>
with a clear title and description.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owner to
license your work under the same license as that used by the project.</p>
